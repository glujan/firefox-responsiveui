# Presets for Firefox Responsive Design View

This repo contains set of popular screen resolutions for Firefox _Responsive Design View_.

To collect CSS resolutions of all those devices I've used [this](http://mydevice.io/devices/) website.

## Usage
To use it go to `about:config` and edit (create new with string value if not present) value of `devtools.responsiveUI.presets` key. Paste content of [presets.json](presets.json) into value field and voil√† - your _Responsive Design View_ has ready-to-work presets.
